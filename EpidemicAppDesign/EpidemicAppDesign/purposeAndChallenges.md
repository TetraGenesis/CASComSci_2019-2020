# Purpose

This app is an assisting app for immunocompromised users that can't afford to go outside but still want to do certain activities or workouts.

- The user should be able to click different links/buttons.
- The user should be able to save their favorite sites.
- The user should be able to go to external sites with each button clicked.
- The user should be able to find support for different abilities and/or handicaps.

## Challenges

This might be difficult to build because every user is different, and creating their own custom settings might be a better idea than having a static list of customizable options. The app must also remember the user's data, so that might also be a little tricky. This app would be cross-platform, so it would take a lot of partnering with those apps and websites for this app to get enough exposure.
